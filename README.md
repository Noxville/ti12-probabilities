# The International 12 Probabilities Visualizer
Frontend (public view) for visualizing generated probabilities

Each prediction snapshot is generated from a 10^5 or 10^6 iteration Monte Carlo simulation and stored for visualization in this project.

Each match with an unknown outcome is simulated using an ensemble method of team ratings and data from datdota.com.
